This project is dedicated to the development of the architecture and implementation of a platform that enables the modeling, execution, and management of closed control loops in Kubernetes. The subject of this work is related to the standardization efforts of ETSI ZSM and ETSI ENI committees, which focus on specifying autonomous and cognitive management systems for telecommunication networks.

In this context, the study emphasizes the implementation aspects of such systems by proposing a solution that allows for flexible definition of the architecture of an autonomous loop, open to integration with external policy engines and analytical applications. This integration facilitates embedding the required decision-making logic within the loop while leveraging implementation mechanisms available in the Kubernetes environment.

The thesis presents a review of related literature, the developed platform, its architecture, and user instructions. A reference implementation of the platform, the underlying technologies, and key decisions made during its development are discussed. Finally, a practical test of the platform's functionality is presented. The study concludes with a summary of findings and potential future development directions for the platform.
